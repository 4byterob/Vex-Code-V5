# Vex-Code
VexCodeV5 Code for the Robotics Competitions
---
Ok so the only file that really matters is the 'main.cpp' one.

Keep in mind that if you copy and paste the code or something similar, you'll have to add all the right motors as well. The motor names and ports are displayed at the top of the code file in comments.

NOTE: I've used the competition template, which is why there's a lot of strange comments instructing you not to 'delete this' or 'remove that'. I'm pretty sure it's a MUST to use the competition template in order to qualify for competitions, so make sure to use that if you're creating a new project.
